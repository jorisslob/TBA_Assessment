/**
 * This package has all the parts of the simulator that are not components of
 * a harbor. The most important class is the Simulator class. It uses the
 * Schedule class for keeping track of time and the Statistics class to keep
 * track of all the results. The Truck class is passed around as a kind of
 * message object with a real physical meaning.
